and Achievement table. Hence, adding an achievement was not
automatically adding the experience to the exp.
- Solved by adding CascadeType.ALL in the OneToMany parameter in the
Experience entity.

 @RequestBody  annotation. Hence, the request body was not being
parsed correctly. Resulting in null values being inserted into the DB.
- Solved by adding the @RequestBody annotation to the controller route.

response had a stack overflow error (recusive call).
- Solved by using @JsonManagedReference  and  @JsonBackReference  annotations.


x Mormalizing the DB schema to reduce redundancy and improve performance
uo to 4NF.
