x Issue with no CASCADE.ALL in the relationship between experience
and Achievement table. Hence, adding an achievement was not
automatically adding the experience to the exp.
- Solved by adding CascadeType.ALL in the OneToMany parameter in the
Experience entity.


 x Issue with Achievement controller route not having
 @RequestBody  annotation. Hence, the request body was not being
parsed correctly. Resulting in null values being inserted into the DB.
- Solved by adding the @RequestBody annotation to the controller route.


x Issue with the  @ManyToOne  annotation in the Skill & SkillCategory entity.
There was a circular reference between the two entities. Hence, the
response had a stack overflow error (recusive call).
- Solved by using @JsonManagedReference  and  @JsonBackReference  annotations.


x Normalizing the DB schema to reduce redundancy and improve performance
uo to 4NF.

x Note: After schema has been initialized first time,
you cant change the schema without dropping the tables.

x note: with css p .className doesnt work, use p.className instead.
